All the deploying sites that are recommended are asking for my payment details and it was difficult to find free deploying service. Especially Heroku. 
In addition my bootcamp is expiring tomorrow and I would appreciate it if the marker could focus on the main requirements of the MERN application as I demonstrated a good understanding of the concept. If not the bootcamp is going to expire and I wouldnâ€™t be able to access my  dashboard and I have to enroll again to access it again. 

Thank you
